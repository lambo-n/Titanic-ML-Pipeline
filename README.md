# Titanic-ML-Pipeline
create a generic data pipeline that can be used to clean any dataset (will provide a list). This pipeline should remove any columns that do not provide value to an ML model, create a train test split, categorize variables, and sort the data so that the response is not in the data (i.e. if someone survived in the titanic dataset).
